## Sequent Retrospectives 

Taking your teamperature every week is a great way to measure know how things are going with the group of people you spend most of your time with.

PRs are welcome keeping in mind:

- It's about the discussion not the tool - anything that promotes better team discussion is welcome.
- Team members should be able to participate from whereever they using whatever device is available so cross browser compatibility on different display formats is really important.
