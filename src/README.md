### Retro Board

This is where your team shares ideas has discussions and creates action items.

Each member logs into the team account and anonymously puts in their team feedback in one of the 3 appropriate buckets.

Everyone sees everyone else's items without knowing who put them in. 

The team then takes a minute to vote on the items then discusses each in a team discussion bonding session.
